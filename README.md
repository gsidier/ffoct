Automated tissue image analysis for samples acquired by Full Field  OCT.

Full-field optical coherence tomography (FFOCT) is a non-invasive technique for the obtaining of 
high-definition tissue images at the cellular level.

Images obtained are similar to those of classical histology obtained by biopsy but with characteristics 
that are specific to this method.

The purpose of this project is to develop algorithms for the automated tissue image analysis of images obtained by FFOCT.
